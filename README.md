# 🛡️ Insurance Premium Calculator

This project is a simple dynamic insurance premium calculator built using Python and designed to run in Google Colab. It calculates personalized insurance premiums based on:

- 👤 Age of the applicant  
- 🚗 Accident history  
- 🏙️ Location (Urban or Rural)  
- 📈 Simulated market conditions

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user inputs their age, accident history, and location.
2. The system calculates a risk score based on these inputs.
3. A market adjustment factor is applied.
4. The final premium is calculated using a base rate and the computed risk score.

## 📊 Sample Output
--- Insurance Quote ---
Age: 24
Past Accidents: Yes
Location: Urban
Final Premium: ₹8925.00

## 🚀 How to Run

### In Google Colab:

1. Open the notebook:  
   `Untitled2.ipynb` (or rename to `insurance_calculator.ipynb`)

2. Run all cells:
   - It will ask for inputs or show widgets (if widgets are used)

3. See the final premium in the output

> You can also download the notebook and run it using Jupyter Notebook locally.
